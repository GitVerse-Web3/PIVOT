0," Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then, in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being ""none of her business."" Only once had she put the doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.
She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on ""by another train."" Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks. ""You must be Miss Hope, the governess I?¡®ve come to meet,"" said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument.
""Very well, if I must I must,"" said Lady Carlotta to herself with dangerous meekness.
""I am Mrs. Quabarl,"" continued the lady; ""and where, pray, is your luggage?""
""It?¡®s gone astray,"" said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. ""I?¡®ve just telegraphed about it,"" she added, with a nearer approach to truth.
""How provoking,"" said Mrs. Quabarl; ""these railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night,"" and she led the way to her car.
During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century.
""I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,"" said Mrs. Quabarl, ""but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week.""
""I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""
""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""
""That will not embarrass me in the least,"" said Lady Carlotta coldly.
Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

""How provoking,"" said Mrs. Quabarl; ""these railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night,"" and she led the way to her car.
During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century.
""I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,"" said Mrs. Quabarl, ""but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week.""
""I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""
""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""
""That will not embarrass me in the least,"" said Lady Carlotta coldly.
Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

Then, in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being ""none of her business."" Only once had she put the doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.
She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on ""by another train.""

        At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their Line parents. ""They jumped up like popcorn,"" he said, describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly. 
Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his
discovery without a key piece of advice from the local rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds?¡® first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher was incredulous. ""He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, ??What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!?¡® "" At first it seemed unnatural?aground birds don?¡®t like the ground? But as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he?¡®d watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought
30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.
Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. ""I asked him how it went,"" Ken recalled, ""and he said,
 ??Terrible! The birds are cheating!?¡® "" Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the ""aha"" moment. ""The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively,"" he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
Working together with Terry (who has since gone on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. ""It?¡®s like the spoiler on the back of a race car,"" he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.
Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.
In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don?¡®t do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis).

discovery without a key piece of advice from the local rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds?¡® first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher was incredulous. ""He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, ??What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!?¡® "" At first it seemed unnatural?aground birds don?¡®t like the ground? But as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he?¡®d watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought
30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.
Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. ""I asked him how it went,"" Ken recalled, ""and he said,
 ??Terrible! The birds are cheating!?¡® "" Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the ""aha"" moment. ""The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively,"" he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
Working together with Terry (who has since gone on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. ""It?¡®s like the spoiler on the back of a race car,"" he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.
Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.
In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don?¡®t do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis).

They observed the baby Chukar Partridges and found that they were using their wings and legs to climb vertical surfaces, and they also discovered that birds have a functional aerodynamic function for half-formed wings that they use to make it to their perches. The discovery of Wing-assisted incline running was a game changer, and it allowed scientists to study more effectively how birds learn to fly and how they deal with steep inclines. The story of the Chukar Partridge and the discovery of Wing-assisted incline running is a shining example of the power of scientific collaboration and problem-solving, and it启示 us to look for patterns in the data and to come up with innovative solutions to problems that we might not have been able to solve on our own.",C,1,6500000000,1099511627776

To solve for k, we can set this equal to 0 and solve for k:

k/y = k/y

y = k, which means that the slope of the line is k.

So, the slope of the line in terms of c and d is:

In the system of equations above, k is a constant and x and y are variables. For what value of k will the system of equations have no solution?
","{'A': '12/5', 'B': '16/7', 'C': '-16/7', 'D': '-12/5'}",A,"To find the value of k for which the system of equations has no solution, we can use the method of substitution. The first equation states that if k is x, then 3y = 4, which means y = (4/3)x. The second equation states that if k is 4x, then 5y = 7, which means y = (7/5)x.

We can use these equations to find x and y for each value of k. For each value of k, we can substitute x and y from the first equation into the second equation to find the value of y. This will tell us if there is a solution to the system of equations.

For example, if k = 4, we can substitute x = (7/5)k into the second equation to find y:

y = (7/5)k = (7/5)4 = 4/3

So there is a solution if k = 4.

For each value of k that is not equal to 4, we can substitute x and y from the first equation into the second equation to find the value of y:

For k = 1: x = (7/5)k = 7/5, y = (4/3)x = 4/3

For k = 2: x = (7/5)k = 7/5, y = (4/3)x = 4/3

For k = 3: x = (7/5)k = 7/5, y = (4/3)x = 4/3

Let x be the variable on the line y = 25. Then we can use the given equation y = (x-11)2 to find x.

x = (y - 11)2 = y2 - 22y + 11

Next, we can use this expression for x to find the value of y, which will give us the point on the line that is parallel to the parabola and intersects it at A and B.

y = (x - 11)2 = x2 - 22x + 11

Substituting this expression for y into the equation y = (x-11)2 to get the final equation:

y = (x-11)2 = x2 - 22x + 11 = x2 - 22x + 26

36,,"y = a(x-2)(x + 4); In the quadratic equation above, a is a nonzero constant. The graph of the equation in the xy-plane is a parabola with vertex (c, d). Which of the following is equal to d ?","{'A': '-9a', 'B': '-8a', 'C': '-5a', 'D': '-2a'}",A,"To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the possible values of d corresponding to the vertex of the parabolabola y = a(x-2)(x+4) can be equal to d.

To do this, we need to determine the value of a that gives the vertex (c, d) when x is set to c. The vertex of a parabola is located where the graph of the function垂直于x轴， and we can use the graph to determine this.

The graph of the function y = a(x-2)(x+4) has two nodes, which we can find by setting x = 2 and x = +4 and noting that these give rise to the two corresponding y values. The function垂直于x轴， so we can use the graph to determine the value of a that gives the vertex.

The graph of the function shows that the vertex is located at (2, 4), and that the value of a corresponding to this vertex is:

- When x = 2, y = -8a
- When x = +4, y = -8a

So we need to determine which of these two values of a is equal to d. We can do this by setting x = +4 and noting that this gives rise to the value of y corresponding to the vertex.

y = -8a(x + 4) = -8a((x+4)+4) = -8a(x+8)

So we need to determine which of the values of x corresponding to the vertex (c, d) we might find when x is +8 (the vertex would be located at x = c = 4).

- When x = 4, y = -8a
- When x = -8, y = -8a

So we can determine that the value of d corresponding to the vertex (c, d) is:

- When x = 4, y = -9a
- When x = -8, y = -8a

So which of the values of d (= d) is equal to d? The values of a corresponding to the vertices (c, d) are:

- When a = -9a, d = -9a
- When a = -8a, d = -8a

-   To find the other number, we need to add the sum of the two numbers x and (2 * x) to get their sum.
-   Next, we need to subtract the sum of x and (2 * x) from 855 to get the value of the third number.

-   3 * x = 855
-   x = 855 / 3
-   x = 266.67

Therefore, the value of x is 266.67. If we wanted to use a different method to find the value of x, we could use the difference between the sum of the two other numbers and the sum of x and (2 * x) to find x. For example, we could use:

-   x = (2 * x) + (sum of two other numbers)
-   x = 266.67 + (sum of two other numbers)

We can also use the information that each student needs 3 ml of solution to have 5 ml left over, and each student needs 4 ml of solution to have an additional 21 ml left over. This gives us the following equation:

3n + 5 = 4n + 21

化简得：

n = 16

将 n = 16 代入公式 N = (n + k) / 2 ，得：

N = (16 + k) / 2 ，其中 k = 5

代入 k = 5 ，得：

N = (16 + 5) / 2 = 21

因此，这位Mr. Kohl拥有21个学生。

Which of the following could be the value of k ?","{'A': '0', 'B': '4', 'C': '8', 'D': '16'}",C,"To determine the value of k, we can use the relationship between the two points (2, k) and (k, 32) to find out where the line will cross the x-axis or y-axis.

The x-axis is parallel to the y-axis and the line will cross the x-axis when k = 0.

The y-axis is parallel to the x-axis and the line will cross the y-axis when k = 32.

So, we can only determine k by finding where the two lines cross. To do this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the sides of a right triangle with legs 2 and 32.

The Pythagorean theorem states that:

Pythagorean theorem: 22 + 32 = 52

So, we can use this to find the length of the side opposite the y-axis (the short side) using the following formula:

length = √(22 + 32) = √52 = 8

So, the length of the side opposite the y-axis is 8.

Next, we can use the two points (2, k) and (k, 32) to find out where the line will cross the x-axis. The x-axis is the vertical line that marks the y-axis in the xy-plane.

The point on the line that is (k, 32) and the point on the line that is (2, k) are both in the xy-plane and can be found by using the x and y coordinates to find out which point is on the line.

If k = 0, then the point on the line that is (2, 0) is also in the xy-plane. So, we can determine where the line will cross the x-axis by finding the point on the line that is (0, 32).

If k = 32, then the point on the line that is (2, 0) is not in the xy-plane and cannot be used to determine where the line will cross the x-axis.

So, the value of k that could be the value of k is A (0) or D (16).",,1,6500000000,1099511627776
48,,"A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by p percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of p ?","{'A': '12', 'B': '15', 'C': '20', 'D': '22'}",C,"To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle as a function of its length and width:

A = l * w

Next, we can use the information in the problem statement to calculate the new area after the alterations:

New A = (1 + 10/100) * (1 - p/100) = 1.1 * (1 - p/100)

Next, we can use this new formula to calculate the new width and length:

New l = 1.1 * l - 0.1p
New w = 1.1 * w - p

Finally, we can use these new values to calculate the new area:

New A = l * w = 1.1 * (1.1 * w - p) - 0.1p = 1.1 * w - 0.1p + p

If we simplify this expression, we get:

New A = 1.1 * w - 0.1p = 1.1 * w - 0.1p + p = 1.1 * (w - p) + p

To find the value of p, we can solve for w:

w = 1.1 * (p - 10) / 100 = (1.1 * p - 10.1) / 100

Next, we can use this value of w to calculate the new width:

New w = 1.1 * p - 10.1 / 100 = (1.1 * p - 10.1) / 100

Finally, we can use this new value of w to calculate the new length:

New l = 1.1 * l - 10.1 / 100 = (1.1 * l - 10.1) / 100

To find the value of p, we can solve for l:

l = 1.1 * l - 10.1 / 100 = (1.1 * l - 10.1) / 100

Next, we can use this value of l to calculate the new width:

New w = 1.1 * w - 10.1 / 100 = (1.1 * w - 10.1) / 100

Finally, we can use this new value of w to calculate the new length:

New l = 1.1 * l - 10.1 / 100 = (1.1 * l - 10.1) / 100

So, the value of p is:

p = 1.1 * (w - p) + 10.1 / 100 = (1.1 * p - 10.1) / 100 + 10.1 / 100 = 1.1 * p - 10.1 / 100 + 10.1 / 100 = 1.1 * p - 10.1 + 10.1 = 1.1 * p + 10

The value of p is 12.",A,1,6500000000,1099511627776

Opened in 2002, it is central to the ambitious ?84.5m Millennium Link project to restore navigability across Scotland by reconnecting the historic waterways of the Forth & Clyde and Union Canals.The major challenge of the project lay in the fact that the Forth & Clyde Canal is situated 35 metres below the level of the Union Canal. Historically, the two canals had been joined near the town of Falkirk by a sequence of 11 locks ¡°C enclosed sections of canal in which the water level could be raised or lowered - that stepped down across a distance of 1.5 km. This had been dismantled in 1933, thereby breaking the link.

Two diametrically opposed water-filled 'gondolas', each with a capacity of 360,000 litres, are fitted between the ends of the arms. These gondolas always weigh the same, whether or not they are carrying boats. This is because, according to Archimedes' principle of displacement, floating objects displace their own weight in water. So when a boat enters a gondola, the amount of water leaving the gondola weighs exactly the same as the boat. This keeps the Wheel balanced and so, despite its enormous mass, it rotates through 180?? in five and a half minutes while using very little power.
